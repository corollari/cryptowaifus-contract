Of the four sacred Canopic Jars which hold the internal organs of the mummified, Serqet is the watcher of one. And, though her strikes mean certain death, Serqet can cleanse poison as easily as apply it.A battlefield is a strange place to find this Goddess. Normally, Serqet is an invisible presence.
