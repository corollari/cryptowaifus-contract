Rin is reared as the successor to her family's magecraft, instructed by her father Tokiomi Toosaka to prioritize sorcery over her own interests.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries ago, the Toosaka House, in collaboration with the estates of Makiri and Einzbern, helped found the Fuyuki Holy Grail Wars. The land of Fuyuki City, which possessed the second greatest spiritual power in all Japan, was owned by Rin's ancestor, Nagato Toosaka; at the behest of the Einzberns, he provided his property as battleground for present and future wars. Nagato was a kirishitan, as well as a pupil of Zelretch; these titles gave him considerable influence in both the Mage's Association and the Church, allowing the Toosaka family to participate in the Holy Grail Wars, free from harassment by either organization.\r\n\r\nRin was brought up as the successor to her family's magecraft, and was instructed by her father to prioritize magecraft over her own interests. Ten years ago, Tokiomi Toosaka was selected as a Master in the 4th Holy Grail War, and Rin was entrusted to take care of the Toosaka estate until his return. Her mother, Aoi Toosaka, was left in a debilitated state from the war, so her care was left to her guardian, Kirei Kotomine.

She was the official leader of Squad 13.\r\n\r\nDue to her feelings for Hiro, she struggles between her selfishness and her responsibilities as a leader. Out if the entire squad, she alienates Zero Two the most and almost succeeds in separating her from Hiro for good until she realizes Zero Two is the only one Hiro loves, which prompts her to give up on him for the sake of his happiness and she eventually finds a new love in Goro at the end of the series.\r\n\r\nIchigo has soft green eyes and a petite build, being the shortest among the parasites in Squad 13.

However, she is strongly emotional and has always been impulsive and driven by her feelings. She is forced between acting as a leader and her own feelings, such as knowingly putting Hiro's life on the line while also acknowledging he's needed, this strain of commanding weighs her down. She would initially let her personal feelings get to her head when in a crucial mission, only to reflect over it when being placed in a dangerous situation. She would think about her poor skills as a leader and blame herself for her putting her friends in danger. She also expresses her anxiety more inside her FRANXX than she does outside of it and is seen breaking down, only to be supported by her FRANXX partner, Goro.\r\n\r\nShe has admired and been fiercely protective of Hiro ever since childhood, and supports Hiro the best she can. She is not afraid to voice her own opinions and get people to follow her orders as a leader. She has been deemed by Zero Two on several occasions as \"bossy\". Despite that, Ichigo does sometimes not say what she truly wants to and is able to put her feelings aside for others if she wants to. This is shown when she lied to Hiro saying she always had seen him as a sibling for his sake and for the sake of the fact that he could only pilot a FRANXX with Zero Two, when in reality she didn't want Hiro to pilot with Zero Two at all due to her feelings towards Hiro and the dangerous risks it could bring him. She is a straight-laced and straightforward person but also always follows the orders she receives, and held a deep respect for Papa.\r\n\r\nOver the series, Ichigo slowly learns to put Hiro's feelings and Squad 13's well-being before her own. She learns to accept and support Hiro and Zero Two's relationship, and become nicer to Zero Two to the point of considering her an integral part of Squad 13. She becomes just as fiercely protective of the others, including Zero Two, as Hiro. This is further emphasized when VIRM left earth and abandoned humanity; Ichigo becomes so dedicated to looking after the others and ensuring they have enough food, clean water, etc. for survival that she forgets to take care of herself, until she collapses outright in the fields. She also becomes a much better leader; she learns to see the big picture and not let her tunnel-visioned emotions consume her, making decisions that benefit the whole group rather than just Hiro or her designs for him, and she isn't as badly shaken when things go wrong.", "tags": [{"id": 1003, "name": "Mecha Pilot"}, {"id": 1014, "name": "blue hair"}], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/52.jpeg", "slug": "ichigo", "alternative_name": "\u30a4\u30c1\u30b4", "birthday_year": "", "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 16863}, {"origin": "Japan", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 118, "name": "AkaTenshi"}, "series": {"description": "The student-filled Academy City is at the forefront of scientific advancement and home to the esper development program.

Some even whisper that Jinx isn't even human, that she is some kind of avenging spirit of mayhem, come to wreak havoc upon Piltover in revenge for the thousands who died when Zaun sank into the earth.\r\n\r\nJinx made her first appearance on Roguery Night, a barely tolerated annual tradition where youthful girls and boys throughout Piltover play practical jokes on their family and neighbors. Jinx hijacked the occasion to unleash the first of many crime sprees; bridges were blocked with stampeding livestock freed from Count Mei's menagerie, scores of roads were shut down by explosions that made them impassable, and every street sign in the city was moved and placed somewhere new. Jinx had succeeded in spreading chaos throughout the streets and bringing the city to a halt. It had been a good day.\r\n\r\nThe wardens attributed her crimes to chem-punk gangs, rounding up dozens of known troublemakers and sending them back down to Zaun. Having others get the credit for her manic schemes didn't sit well with Jinx, and so she made sure to be seen at every future crime scene. Reports circulated of a mysterious, blue-haired Zaunite girl, but talk of her carrying chemtech Flame Chompers!.png explosives, a shark-mouthed Switcheroo!.png launcher and a Switcheroo! 2.png repeater gun were dismissed as preposterous. After all, how could a Zaunite chem-punk possibly obtain such lethal firearms?\r\n\r\nThe crime spree escalated in lunacy until Jinx detonated a series of explosives simultaneously throughout the city. A great many of the civic art structures erected by the Piltover clans were destroyed in fiery conflagrations that lit the sky in blazing pyrotechnics until dawn. Due to the late hour, no one was hurt, but numerous clan leaders were outraged at the sight of their great works reduced to rubble.\r\n\r\nJinx's crime wave continued for weeks, with the wardens' attempts to catch her thwarted at every turn. She tagged her crime scenes with insulting graffiti and taunting messages directed at Piltover's newest ally in the fight against crime, Enforcer Vi Vi. These bright pink tags finally revealed the name of Piltover's newest troublemaker: Jinx.\r\n\r\nWith every bold crime, Jinx became ever more legendary, with people in Zaun divided as to whether she was a hero for sticking it to the Pilties or a dangerous lunatic that would bring the full force of the wardens down to the undercity. That moment came even closer when Jinx sabotaged the Sun Gates and delayed the flow of ships by several hours - costing the city's ruling clans vast sums of lost revenue.\r\n\r\nHaving seen exactly which buttons to press, Jinx offered a challenge that couldn't be ignored - she threatened Piltover's money. She daubed the walls of the Ecliptic Vaults, one of Piltover\u2019s most secure treasuries, with a caricature of Enforcer Vi, together with details of exactly when Jinx planned to rob it.\r\n\r\nAn uneasy sense of anticipation settled on Piltover and Zaun in the weeks leading up to the appointed date of Jinx's heist. Many doubted Jinx would have the guts to show up and risk almost certain capture. When the day of the heist arrived, Vi, Caitlyn Caitlyn, and the wardens were taking no chances and had prepared a trap for Jinx around the treasury. The clocktower bells rang at the appointed hour, but nothing happened. It seemed Jinx had chickened out, but she was one step ahead of her would-be captors.\r\n\r\nJinx, despite the seeming recklessness of her actions, had a plan and it had been in motion for days. She had hidden herself within a modified coin-crate at the Toll Towers of the Sun Gates and had been delivered to the vaults two days previously. Jinx was already inside, and was even now wreaking havoc, leaving her signature pink tags on every gilded wall, swinging from the chandeliers, and leaving explosive surprises in every lockbox.\r\n\r\nHearing the cacophony from within, Vi realized what was happening. She stormed inside the building, ignoring Caitlyn's order to go in as a team. The battle they fought tore the vaults to pieces in a back and forth chase of explosions and demolition. Eventually Jinx and Vi confronted one another in the deepest, most secure vault. No one knows what passed between them, for Vi had pursued Jinx far ahead of the others. With the two of them trapped together underground, Jinx fired her rockets into the ceiling of the vault, and the entire structure collapsed. The wardens in the upper reaches of the vault escaped before the building came down, but Vi was left trapped inside. Only by hiding in the same lockbox Jinx had used to break in was she able to avoid being crushed to death. Eventually she punched her way out from the ruins, wondering for a moment if Jinx lay dead somewhere in the ruins, only to see one last tag left in the patterns of destruction - a final taunt daring Vi to catch her. No trace of the blue-haired hellion could be found, and to add insult to injury, not a single coin had been taken from the vaults.\r\n\r\nJinx remains at large to this day, and is a constant thorn in Piltover's side. Her actions have inspired copycats among the chem-punk gangs of Zaun as well as numerous satirical plays, sayings and the like throughout both cities. Her ultimate end-game (or why she is seemingly obsessed with Vi) remains a mystery, but one thing is certain: her crimes are continuing and growing in sheer audacity.", "tags": [], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/64.png", "slug": "jinx", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 702}, {"origin": "The Empire", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 4713, "name": "yrulaughing"}, "series": {"description": "Night Raid is the covert assassination branch of the Revolutionary Army, an uprising assembled to overthrow Prime Minister Honest, whose avarice and greed for power has lead him to take advantage of the child emperor's inexperience.

During her first appearances, she comes across slightly air-headed and hot-tempered. In the official art book, she is described as a person who \"drips with dissatisfaction the moment she opens her mouth\" and tends to be in trouble with her classmates. She is also mentioned to be a bit too talkative with an overly carefree attitude.\r\nHowever, Junko's real personality that is revealed at the conclusion of the Mutual Killing incident of Class 78th is notably different. Her true personality appears to be very apathetic and easily bored, to the unhealthy and abnormal degree. Because of this, her behavior and mannerisms tended to be extremely erratic and unstable by her own autonomous design; keeping up one \"appearance\" for too long bores her, which causes her to often switch between different personas. However, she is capable of maintaining one persona for extended periods of time when necessary, such as when she was overseeing the students through Monokuma. Junko's \"moods\" included (but were not limited to) her Monokuma persona, sickening cuteness, severe depression, clinical sophistication, and haughty superiority. She switched between \"moods\" regularly, often imitating other students' expressions, which made for a highly unsettling conversation to the survivors. While entering the Hope's Peak Academy as one of Class 78th students, she often talked in her narration-style and writes it in a notebook.\r\n\r\nAbove all, Junko was deeply obsessed with despair, having found despair to be the most (and possibly the only) enjoyable emotion for her, whether it be the inflicting of despair unto others, or suffering from despair wholeheartedly. This made her extremely dangerous, as she wished to make the whole world feel absolute despair. However, this also often proved to be her biggest weakness, as she gave her opponents a \"fair\" chance to defeat her in order to make their despair all the greater if they fail, and happily welcomed her own despair if her plans fail. Both Junko herself and the game's creators have confirmed that she truly has no reason to do things she does other than despair itself, which makes her all the more dangerous and unable to reason with.\r\n\r\nIn Danganronpa/Zero, it's revealed that her love for despair developed at quite young age due to an unknown reason, and that her true talent is her near supernatural analytical skills. It's also shown that under her amnesiac state, Junko doesn't show a thirst for despair or particularly strong hate for boredom, implying that her constant case of forgetfulness had spared her from embracing despair again. However, the return of her memories brought her back to her former ways. In Danganronpa 3, it's finally revealed that similar to Izuru Kamukura, her talent is the reason why she is easily bored with the world and seeks out unpredictable despair to free herself from the said boredom.\r\n\r\nAs a mastermind and leader of Ultimate Despair, Junko was shown to be highly intelligent, cunning, somewhat impulsive, and extremely manipulative, violent and cruel without remorse. She was both physically and mentally abusive, highly toxic individual. She manipulated people into falling madly in love with her and used their weaknesses, their despair, against them. Things like hope, peace, and happiness disgusted her, but she sometimes gave hope to others, only to turn it into despair later. She often manipulated people into doing bad things instead of directly doing them herself, and then had a habit of blaming these manipulated people and claiming it wasn't her fault, as a part of proving her point that despair exists in everyone and that hope will naturally lose to that despair. While she is very skilled, Junko can also lie and cheat to further her own goals, even if it's hypocritical and goes against her beliefs. It should be noted that even though she claims despair is the great unknown, in the end the road of despair went exactly the way she had planned.\r\n\r\nWhile very abusive and cruel even towards her loved ones, it's implied that she felt at least some care for them, in her own messed-up way. It is interesting to note that the two people who Junko loved the most (Mukuro and Yasuke) are the only people shown in canon to be killed directly by her: Mukuro through the Spears of Gungnir and Yasuke through stabbing, whereas most of her other victims were killed indirectly through executions. This is likely because killing those she holds most dear would cause her great despair and to Junko, the greater the despair, the better.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kazutaka Kodaka and Junko's voice actress, her personality in Side: Despair is more natural version of her, closer to her true self and more neutral, before she started changing her personalities regularly. This seems to imply that her behavior in the first game is a result of decreasing mental health and deeper sinking into despair, explaining the more jaded and apathetic personality.", "tags": [], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/167.png", "slug": "junko-enoshima", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 702}, {"origin": "Kalos", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 654, "name": "Uraby_"}, "series": {"description": "Pokemon are peculiar creatures with a vast array of different abilities and appearances; many people, known as Pokemon trainers, capture and train them, often with the intent of battling others.

She claims she had received the command of God to fight. She heard the Lord\u2019s lament that the world changed straight into hell. The Lord wept into sorrow as no one could stop it and people were not even allowed to live simply, and were compelled to become either beasts or food. Conflict never ended, and blood continued to rain incessantly and soak the land. She received a revelation from the Lord, the voice contained no glory or victory, no obligation or sense of purpose but only the Lord laments. She caught his small, feeble murmurs that everyone else failed to hear. She responded by throwing away her life as a simple villager and the joy of loving someone and being loved back. Furthermore, there would be no compensation. She knew she would surely be scorned by the masses of both enemies and allies alike. It was a very terrifying thing to contemplate. It was mad for a mere village girl from the countryside to leap onto the battlefield where people\u2019s killing intent swirled about. She could not turn her back on the Lord's cries. She decided to devote her life to oppose this world\u2019s hell to help stop the Lord\u2019s tears and soothe Him. She clad her armour on her body, hang a sword on her waist and carry the flag. She fought alongside with Gilles de Rais.\r\nHaving been born to a peasant family, Joan never knew the contents of the many books of prayer. She did try hard to learn them, but it seems she was simply born incapable of reading or writing. The most she ever managed was learning how to sign her name. While she worried about this, in the end, she decided that she needed little more in order to pray to the Lord. As she recalled, one of her comrades whom rode beside her, Gilles, once laughed and promised her that that was more than enough.\r\nThey say that in reality all that happened was that she used tactics that the knights of that time didn't use out of contempt and honour. She is noted to be one of the Heroic Spirits in recent history who utilized the power of the Counter Force to accomplish her deeds as a hero.\r\nBoth Jeanne and Gilles were decorated as saviors and national heroes by King Charles in the cathedral with the ars nova melody playing in the background.\r\nJeanne was put to death at Place du Vieux-March\u00e9 in Rouen. Scorned by words of damnation as she was led to the pyre and feeling only slightly pained as she endured it, she had already abandoned emotions such as fear, disappointment, and regret from the outset of her battles, so she was able to walk towards her death without faltering in her steps. As she unconsciously reached for the cross that had been at her chest until they took it from her, she felt some sadness as there was nothing to support heart. Shortly after, she was given a wooden cross fashioned by an Englishman who revered her, thanking him quietly as he knelt and wept. Her hands were tied to a wooden stake behind her, and the priest present completed the recitation of her final judgement before throwing the torch upon the pyre. As they believes that the loss of the flesh was the greatest of fears, it was the cruelest punishment that could be laid upon her.\r\nThe flames began to burn her skin, scorch her flesh, and char her bones, all while she spoke the name of the Lord and the Holy Mother against those who denounced her prayers as only a lie. She could only find such thoughts strange, believing that prayers are nothing more than prayers, no matter to whom is prayed, that carry no intrinsic truths or falsehoods. Although she wished to tell them of the thought, she was unable to produce any sound. As she burned, she saw visions of her past, her ordinary family in her rustic village and herself, \"the fool who ran away and tossed all of that aside.\" Having known how her journey would end from the start, she felt that she may have certainly been foolish in her actions, that she may have been able to lived a regular life, gotten married, and lived together with her husband and child.\r\nHad she simply shut away the voice and abandoned the lamenting soldiers, she could have had that life, but felt that it was not a mistake to have walked her path due to those she had saved. She knew from the moment she chose to take to battle that she would have such an end, and she felt that she would never come to self-derision for her choices. Her past, impossible futures, and the cruel reality before her were meaningless before her prayers, offering herself that even if all other condemn her that she would not betray herself. Rather than continue to look back on her path or crave for another future, she only wished for a silent rest. Within the savagery, she only kept a single prayer within her heart to the very end, one unblemished by regret and filled with sincerity. As she said her final words, \"...O Lord, I give myself to You...\", her consciousnesses ended and she was released from her suffering. Although the girl's dream ended there, \"the dream of La Pucelle was only just beginning.\"\r\nHer death had caused Gilles de Rais to go insane, turn his back on God to practice black magic, and commit atrocities before he was captured and hanged to death.\r\n\r\nShe has no wish for the Holy Grail but if there were to have one, it would only be that the Greater Grail War be conducted correctly. She doesn't mind if the person wishes a personal desire in front of the Holy Grail. As long as it doesn\u2019t beckon the world\u2019s destruction, she would properly respect the wish.\r\nShe doesn't have a single regret regarding in her lifetime. She does not wish revenge or wish to be saved and it was enough for her to know the life that she lived alone.\r\nShe does not believe that God had forsaken her in her last moment but rather that the Lord has never forsaken a single person. There was just nothing he could have done. Praying, giving offerings, everything is an act not for oneself, but for the Lord. She believes prayer will heal the Lord's laments and sorrow. The moment her prayer began, she became separated from the world\u2014removed from the past, the future, and reality itself. She was there not for any particular purpose, but simply to offer a prayer to God. By doing so, the course which she ought to take would come to be fixed. To her, every second of prayer is as important as every breath she takes; a day will not pass where she does not pray. She had a strange habit of comically poking Gilles in the eyes when ever he was least suspecting.", "tags": [{"id": 28, "name": "swordsman"}], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/175.png", "slug": "jeanne-d-arc-2", "alternative_name": "Ruler", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 34}, {"origin": "", "weight": "45.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 575, "name": "Aselgeia"}, "series": {"description": "Japan, 2039.

Oftentimes, she is often seen drinking directly from a large beer barrel.[17] She started drinking at the age of thirteen, two years before the legal age, and the frequency of her drinking has grown to the point where thirty percent of Fairy Tail's liquor budget goes down her throat.[1] Despite her drinking and somewhat laid-back attitude, Cana is one of the more serious members of the guild: she hardly ever goofs off (except when she's drinking), unlike the majority of the other members.[18] She is very focused on the situation at hand. She seems to harbor some romantic feelings for Macao Conbolt, her drinking buddy, as when he suggested she cut down a bit she did so. But when she discovered he had a new girlfriend she returned to drinking and even doubled her quantity.[1] In the guild itself, Cana often assumes leadership in dire situations, such as during the fight against Phantom Lord, and assesses situations in a logical manner.[19] She is extremely loyal to the guild and its members, regardless of how new they are or what their background may be.[20] In addition, Cana always stands up for her dreams (to become an S-Class Mage) and is rather tenacious, as shown when she attacked Freed, despite being unable to defeat him in the past, without hesitation during their S-Class Mage Promotion Trial battle.[21] However, the S-Class exam showed another side of her. She demonstrated a very selfish side, one which was willing to betray her teammates to become an S-Class Mage. This goal and selfishness of hers caused her to even put her own guildmates in peril.[22] This desperation actually stemmed from her desire to confess to her father.[23] However, upon realizing her mistake she became deeply depressed and tried to rectify her mistake.[24] In addition, Cana easily harbors guilt over harming a fellow guild member, this was shown when Mavis asked her to destroy her ethereal body. Despite the fact Cana knew that it was for the greater good, she showed hesitance throughout the process, and had to be reminded by Mavis that it could change the outcome of the war.[25]\r\nAs a child, she didn't have much interest in drinking and she was much more mature than the other young members of the guild, acting like an older sister figure to them.", "tags": [{"id": 1419, "name": "heavy drinker"}, {"id": 1109, "name": "tattoo"}], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/226.png", "slug": "cana-alberona", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 702}, {"origin": "Sunakagure", "weight": "47.90", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 656, "name": "rechal"}, "series": {"description": "", "id": 116, "slug": "naruto", "name": "Naruto"}, "height": "165.00", "birthday_day": null, "likes": 358, "id": 227, "bust": "0.00", "name": "Temari Nara", "birthday_month": null, "trash": 62, "blood_type": "O", "hip": "0.00", "description": "Temari Nara (\u5948\u826f\u30c6\u30de\u30ea, Nara Temari) is a kunoichi from Sunagakure's Kazekage clan, and the eldest of the Three Sand Siblings.

Of the ten, Anko was the only one to survive, establishing the one-in-ten chance of surviving the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru supposedly rejected Anko as a subordinate, believing she did not have the lust for power or vengeance needed to fuel the Cursed Seal. Orochimaru lost interest in her, though he believed there was some value in letting her live.

Yuki's diary is called the Random Diary, which written from his point of view, gives a detailed explanation of his surroundings very accurately whether it be the present or the future. While versatile in any situation, the main disadvantage of the Random Diary is that it doesn't tells him what is happening to himself which leaves him vulnerable.

Because he is weak, in order to protect himself, he quickly makes friends and allies to help him including Yuno Gasai, a girl in his class who is madly in love with him and is another diary user.

She also loves playing her drums despite being hardly willed to practice.\r\n\r\nRitsu has a liking for the band The Who and admires their drummer Keith Moon, although she dislikes his various past rampages. When it comes to music, Ritsu prefers rock. She also likes metal or punk; as long as it has a good beat, it's alright.\r\n\r\nRitsu is very athletic and has by far the best physical condition of all members of the Light Music Club. Physical Education is the only subject she is naturally good at.\r\n\r\nRitsu has a strong sense of confidence from an unknown source, although her confidence has often lead to the club's despair, such as when losing their way in the middle of Ky\u014dto. One of her trademarks and habits is putting both arms at the back of her head. She is also very curious and therefore knowledgeable of many places to have fun at, a fact her friend Tsumugi Kotobuki admires.\r\n\r\nRitsu has a tough front and would not cry easily. Her weak spot is seeing her friends cry and she would do anything to cheer them up, like denying the fact that she is crying too, despite it being obvious.\r\n\r\nRitsu is a surprisingly good cook and is also very creative, using a hexagonal pen in exams to use it to determine the answer she should choose, regarding the number she diced. In stressful situations however, she quickly loses her head and tries desperate attempts to save the situation.\r\n\r\nAlthough she usually acts boyish and childish, she sometimes shows a girly and shy side, for example when she thought about Mio's lyrics to be a love letter for her or when she had to play the role of Juliet in her class' school act. She can also be very thoughtful, as seen when she recalled her past.\r\n\r\nWhen Ritsu gets in a bad mood, the atmosphere gets really intense since it is completely against her character. An example would be her jealous side, which she shows when Mio ignores her and spends instead more time with others like Nodoka Manabe. Her closeness, and sometimes codependency with Mio, is showcased when her body reacts and she becomes ill in an attempt to win back Mio's attention. Despite her mostly immature behavior, she has in fact common sense, especially when her unreliable teacher Sawako is around.", "tags": [{"id": 739, "name": "club president"}, {"id": 1002, "name": "Musician"}], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/245.png", "slug": "ritsu-tainaka", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 711}, {"origin": "", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 709, "name": "_Shadow336_"}, "series": {"description": "Not every zombie is the monstrous, brain-eating type.\r\n\r\nOne night while walking home from the convenience store, regular high school boy Ayumu Aikawa is killed by a serial killer, and is just as suddenly brought back to life by a necromancer named Eucliwood Hellscythe.

Even when face to face, Moeka prefers to communicate by email, to the point where if her phone is taken away, she will almost refuse to speak until her phone is returned.\r\n\r\nPersonality wise, Moeka is quiet, absent-minded, reserved, has difficulties interacting with people, and seen to be expressionless most of the time without actually reacting towards anyone or anything, except for certain situations; her preferred form of communication is via text messages even if the person she is \"talking\" to is right in front of her. Therefore, Moeka is very protective of her phone and becomes agitated if someone tries to take it from her hands.\r\n\r\nNever shown to interact with anyone properly, Due to a certain turn of events in her past, Moeka is quite clumsy and the type of person that does not know how to take care of herself.\r\n\r\nVia mails, Moeka is a cheerful and charismatic person, contrasting highly with her real-life personality. She constantly use emojis like \"(^ ^)\", \"(T_T)\", \"(>_<)\", \"\u266a\" and a variety of others, Moeka also uses some Netspeak expressions like \"lmao\", \"lol\" and \"orz\". Though behaving inexpressive and gloomy in real life, Moeka behaves childish and amusing via mails. Despite this, Moeka does not have confidence, and seems to have an inferiority complex.\r\n\r\nAt heart, behind her expressionless face, Moeka is just a lonely and extremely fragile girl who desperately wants to be accepted and cherished by someone. As she was neglected (or bullied) by every person she met, Moeka became depressed, very sick, and with hints of paranoid personality disorder. \r\n\r\n\r\n                                            [(SPOILERS BEYOND)]\r\n Then, FB contacted her and made her feel loved and accepted. Moeka believed that FB was the only one in the world who was a good and accepting person, due to not having anyone that cared about her; the rest of the world to Moeka was empty, devoid of life, and cruel. Thus, she started isolating herself from people, thinking that FB was the only one that could truly understand her and fearing going through her past again. When her relationship with FB, which meant life to Moeka, required her to kill someone, she killed. By taking another\u2019s life, her life retained meaning. While Moeka is capable of carrying out atrocities for acceptance, she strives to be loved and has the potential to be a good person if led in the right direction. This is reflected in Moeka's image song, \"To be Loved\".\r\n\r\nIn the Gamma world line, Moeka is very different from the Alpha and Beta\u2019s Moeka. She is very responsible, serious, and incredibly perceptive. One could even call her cold-hearted, since she easily killed, with Okarin, two Europol agents. Moeka can also talk normally without using mails, though she says she's not good with conversations, she apparently has more confidence in herself and isn't so devoted to the person that saved her in this world line. However, she constantly worries about Okarin, as he gave her a reason to live, and saved her life various times. She considers FB and Okarin as her family, and though not realising, harbors feelings for Okarin.\r\n\r\nIn the Delta timeline, Moeka is much more friendly, though she is still introverted and depressed. She also shows a lot of creativity, as she manages to write a famous romance novel without any experience on it, however, she implies that she used her relationship with Okarin as a base. Moeka is convinced that she is unneeded by everyone, as people always told her that she was an unwanted child, thus making a wall between her and society and not showing anyone her real feelings. However, after Okarin makes an unbreakable bond with her, and breaks the wall Moeka made between her and people, she smiles more and start showing more of her feelings; She manages to have a normal and happy life, with Okarin and the Laboratory Members by her side. (Moeka's route)\r\n\r\nMoeka's childhood is unknown. However, Darling of Loving Vows implies that she was born from an unwanted pregnancy. As her parents did not want to have her, they often abused Moeka physically and mentally. Can be speculated that or they abandoned her or had an unfortunate death.\r\n\r\nMoeka was a constantly bullied social outcast; she desperately tried to make friends and find a place to belong, but failed miserably due to her social paranoia. In 2004, she fell into a deep depression due to hating everything and being hopeless, thinking that she no longer had a reason to live, Moeka decided to commit suicide. She drank several sleeping pills, hoping that she would die, but to no avail. As the pills were not working, her final attempt was to jump off a large building. At that moment, she received a mail from the enigmatic FB recruiting her to the Rounders, a SERN unit, changing her life forever. As FB often communicated with Moeka and acted as a mother figure towards her, speaking with Moeka about her problems and comforting her, she came to see FB as the person that gave her life meaning and devoted every waking moment to sending mails to them and carrying out their given orders, developing a dependency on FB and their mails.\r\n[(SPOILERS END)]\r\n\r\n", "tags": [{"id": 649, "name": "quiet"}, {"id": 647, "name": "pink eyes"}], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/259.jpeg", "slug": "kiryuu-moeka", "alternative_name": "\u6850\u751f\u840c\u90c1", "birthday_year": "2017", "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 2335}, {"origin": "Japan", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 1437, "name": "Kumashock"}, "series": {"description": "Yato, a minor god, dreams to become the most revered deity in the world with big shrine and all.

Bred for the sole purpose of piloting these machines, these children know nothing of the outside world and are only able to prove their existence by defending their race. \r\n\r\nHiro, an aspiring FranXX pilot, has lost his motivation and self-confidence after failing an aptitude test. Skipping out on his class' graduation ceremony, Hiro retreats to a forest lake, where he encounters a mysterious girl with two horns growing out of her head. She introduces herself by her codename Zero Two, which is known to belong to an infamous FranXX pilot known as the \"Partner Killer.\" Before Hiro can digest the encounter, the Plantation is rocked by a sudden Klaxosaur attack. Zero Two engages the creature in her FranXX, but it is heavily damaged in the skirmish and crashes near Hiro. Finding her partner dead, Zero Two invites Hiro to pilot the mecha with her, and the duo easily defeats the Klaxosaur in the ensuing fight.

She was a human-klaxo sapiens hybrid and a member of the APE Special Force fighting on the front lines. An elite Parasite with the codename \"002\" who was also known as the \"Partner Killer\", Zero Two had always accepted solitude due to her horns and Klaxosaur blood. Despite having no regard for human life or her own and being used to fight alone, she took an interest in Hiro and decided to give him a chance to pilot with her, making him her new partner and \"darling\". After Hiro was able to ride with her more than three times, the pair became the 13th Plantation's newest members, piloting a FRANXX called Strelizia.\r\n\r\nOver the time spent together, Zero Two came to develop special feelings towards Hiro, but her determination to become human coupled with Hiro's apparent fear of her increasingly feral characteristics made her begin seeing him as nothing more than an outlet to become human. When their relationship as partners began to take a turn and slowly crumble, she remembered her forgotten feelings of love towards Hiro during childhood along with her current feelings. The two eventually became a couple before their demise.\r\n\r\nAs a child, Zero Two looked much more like a monster, with red skin, long sharp nails, and fanged teeth. While her eye color was the same, her sclera was red instead of white. Her horns were also much larger in comparison to her head, and her hair was a lighter shade of pink. In terms of clothes all she was given was a dark grey cloak, and white wrappings from Hiro that substituted for shoes.\r\n\r\nAs she grew up, Zero Two developed a fair and light complexion. She had a slender and athletic figure; she was the tallest girl in the squad and even taller than most of the boys as well. She had waist-length, long pink hair with straight bangs covering her forehead and a pair of red horns on her head and a white limiter headband over her horns. She had sharp, cyan eyes with rings around the pupils and pinkish-red eyeliner.\r\n\r\nZero Two's full ensemble was composed of a white military cap with a matching overcoat and boots. She was often seen wearing her signature red uniform, black tights, and white boots. Zero Two's original pilot uniform was a tight, dark red bodysuit with a cap of the same color, similar to the 9's pilot uniform. After she became an official Plantation 13 Parasite, she, like the other Squad 13 Pistils, started wearing a white uniform, with red accents to represent the FRANXX she pilots.\r\n\r\nAs side effects of aggressively riding Strelizia, Zero Two's fangs and horns can grow at an alarming rate. Her eyes shine red when angered, even while wearing her limiter headband. It once got to the point when her face was deathly pale and her eyes blood red. Her horns can also branch out to the point of being able to touch the ceiling, and her skin color can also revert back to her original red color.\r\n\r\nIn Episode 17, Zero Two was given a flower headband by Miku and she wore it for the rest of the episode.\r\n\r\nIn Episode 23, Zero Two merges with her FRANXX and transforms into Strelizia's True Apus form. In this form, its faceplate is replaced by Zero Two's face, in which she has more pronounced lips and a pinkish lip color. She had a white helmet with red lines with a blue horn-like weapon on top of it. There was also a veil-like sheet of light behind Apus' helm. Strelizia True Apus' legs changed into a semblance of a white, shoulder-less and bare-back dress with green accents. In one of the MATO comics, Strelizia True Apus is considered to be Zero Two's wedding dress.\r\n\r\nEver since she was a child, Zero Two had been alone due to her Klaxosaur blood, always being seen as a \"monster\". The way people treated her as a child made her lose faith in people which is especially seen when she was a child: being very defensive or aggressive when people tried to interact with her. Besides that, Zero Two acted like a wild animal or a feral child, eating with her hands, growling, making other vocal noises instead of speaking and chasing after some mice that were near her. However, Zero Two was also shown to a fairly cheerful, curious, and happy girl, and it was during her time with Hiro that shaped much of her personality and quirks in the present, such as her sweet tooth, the way she referred to herself as (\"boku\"), and the nickname she had for Hiro, \"Darling\". Because Hiro treated her as he would anyone else, whereas others didn't treat her as a human for one reason or another, Zero Two developed a deep admiration and liking towards him. Despite having her memories of the darling from her childhood erased, Zero Two retained some fragmented memories which was why she strived to become human no matter what.\r\n\r\nAs she grew up, Zero Two's personality was rumored to be dangerous, cold, and alluring. She was an elite pilot with the pseudonym \"Partner Killer\", given the mysterious cases of her co-pilots dying after a short number of FRANXX rides. However, she appeared to be playful towards Hiro and sometimes showed humor; which is evident during their first meeting. However, she prioritized her duty as a Parasite more than anything, not because she wanted to protect Papa and the others, but because she wanted to \"become human\". Her outlook on life was quite cynical which is why she didn't bother with a name since they were all meant to fight and die. She had also been a prized military asset of APE and sent to fight on the front lines for so long that she had no regard for human life or her own, since they all would become a statistic when they died anyway. When people around her died, she hardly batted an eye at it because, to her, it was just a fact of life that everyone dies. Zero Two always kept people at arm's length with mocking humor, nihilism, and emotional detachment. Zero Two also freely talked about how much she hated their society. However, after seeing Hiro's determination to pilot with her, Zero Two noted that they were very similar and she invited him to partner up with her, despite having fought alone during the majority of her life and never leaning on others for support.\r\n\r\nIt is later seen that Zero Two was a very unruly, passionate, fierce-tempered, self-confident, smug, assertive and carefree girl who hated to follow the rules set up by the adults. She was very outspoken and honest, and unlike the other Parasites, she did not care about Papa and held no respect for him and the other Sages, only seeing them as people who lied to her throughout her childhood. Her seemingly care-free rule-breaking helped break Hiro out of his crippling depression and blind adherence to rules, and the cheerful affection she showed him in the Parasite's quarters inspired some of the other Squad 13 Parasites to be more affectionate with each other. Zero Two's behavior was also quite childlike, as evidenced by when she wiped her hands on Zorome's uniform. Zero Two also demonstrated impressive agility, performing somersaults and flips then landing on her feet every time. During the Girls vs Boy feud, Zero Two tricked the girls into believing she would cooperate with them, after which she tricked the boys into walking in on the girls while they were bathing, then proceeding to steal both the boys' and the girls' clothes. While being chased by Hiro, she teased him and laughed while running throughout the house. By doing that, she felt just a little more like a human. While an exceptionally gifted parasite, Zero Two also had extremely odd quirks: eating with her hands, often licking people, such as herself, though she didn't like how she tasted; Hiro, who tastes like danger; Ichigo, who tastes sweet; and Ikuno, who taste like a secret. She also often mused about how she wanted to go in the ocean, dousing her food in honey, and having no sense of personal space.\r\n\r\nIt was also implied that she knew more about the outside world than the other members of Squad 13. She also appeared to be more knowledgeable about different things than the others, as she knew what a \"kiss\" was, what came \"after kissing\" and the meaning behind \"love\". She also urged the Parasites to speak up for themselves and do what they think is right before they regret it and before \"it's too late\". Zero Two also clearly didn't mind whether she's wearing clothes or not, judging how she didn't even bat an eye about Hiro seeing her naked and instead picked on him for holding her panties.\r\n\r\nHowever, soon after, Zero Two became more obsessed than ever to become human and to reunite with her original darling. She became more melancholic and silent, barely speaking or showing any affection to Hiro, despite her behavior in previous episodes. When Hiro would ask her to talk to him about her problems because he wanted them to understand each other, Zero Two coldly rejected him and she stated that they could understand each other well enough by piloting Strelizia. While fighting Klaxosaurs, Zero Two acted recklessly, disregarding Ichigo's orders and plans, and getting irritated by Hiro getting in her way. Zero Two became much more aggressive both to Hiro and while battling Klaxosaurs, chasing the Klaxosaurs until she was away from the group and then repeatedly stabbing a Klaxosaur corpse she had just killed, maddeningly saying she will kill more Klaxosaurs. When Zero Two started getting a little too obsessed with killing Klaxosaurs during a mission in, Hiro tried to rein her in. However, in the heat of the moment, she ended up choking him and said things that were heard by the others that heavily imply she was going to kill him like so many of her other co-pilots in the past.\r\n\r\nZero Two also seemed to only care about herself, so much so that even when Hiro was dying, it seemed like she couldn't be brought to care when Ichigo demanded she takes it easy on him. That having been said, she had deep insecurities about not being human. Though she hates it when other people bring up the fact she's not human and when people call her a monster, she can be very self-depreciating about it herself and even calls herself one. Additionally, her hatred for Klaxosaurs stems from the fear of becoming one herself. Her desire to avoid this, however, caused her to act more monstrous. This problem escalated when she developed a hatred towards mirrors, as she was seen crushing the hand mirror that Hiro had gifted her in frustration, and proceeded to smash every single mirror throughout the boarding house, possibly due to them reflecting her more monstrous appearance. It only gets worse later on, where she came to consider herself a monster not for a what she was, but for the horrible things she had done. Zero Two did also not appreciate \"friendship\" and never took it seriously because she was convinced that Squad 13 would never accept her, so she didn't even bother trying to be nice to them or show consideration for their lives. Zero Two didn't display any concern for the lives of any pilot besides Hiro, because she thought of them the same she thinks of herself: they are all meant to live and die fighting Klaxosaurs. However, it is clearer in the following episodes that she really had come to care about the other Parasites in Squad 13 and felt guilty for betraying their trust, but stubbornly willed herself to keep displaying no empathy for them and to outwardly insist that she never considered them true friends, just temporary allies.\r\n\r\nHowever, after she realized that Hiro was indeed her darling from her childhood, Zero Two felt extremely apologetic and distraught about her actions. With Ichigo fed up with Zero Two's antics, however, she forcefully disallowed her and Hiro to even visit. Ichigo even proposed to Nana that unless Zero Two were to be kicked out from Squad 13, they would not cooperate at the upcoming mission, much to Zero Two\u2019s disbelief and frustration. Later, Goro was finally able to convince Ichigo to let Zero Two visit her darling. However, when the squad arrived at Hiro's hospital room, he was not there. Hiro\u2019s sudden disappearance enraged Zero Two; she felt deceived and proceeded to beat up the members of Squad 13, mainly Ichigo. When Hiro came back and unintentionally called Zero Two a monster, Zero Two finally broke down, leading to her deportation. Later when Hiro finally reunited with her, Zero Two was afraid of being touched and seen by him, because she considered herself a monster and didn't think she deserved forgiveness after what she had done. However, after Hiro fully forgave her, apologized for calling her a monster, and promised her that they would talk out their problems and always be together, they confessed their love for each other and became an official couple. After this incident and officially being accepted by Squad 13, Zero Two admitted that she finally understood what \"being human\" really meant; living together with other humans, helping each other while also being true to their feelings. Thanks to this discovery, Zero Two's personality reverted back to her former personality, becoming much more friendly, responsible, cheerful, and composed. She also accepted herself, as she could happily look at herself and her horns in the mirror. Despite that, she was concerned when Hiro turned into part-Klaxosaur like herself, stating that she wanted him to remain human. Zero Two was able to acknowledge her mistakes which is why she was determined to do everything right, especially in regards to her friends. She also felt guilty over her past actions and started having nightmares over the stamens she had consumed.\r\n\r\nZero Two regained her curious and carefree nature, doing things in her own pace and stating that she was intersted in traveling the world like the Princess in her book. She also retained her playful personality as she was visibly seen to be sassy and energetic, not afraid to get what she wanted to without putting up a friendly fight. Furthermore, she became more open to her fellow comrades in Squad 13, openly socializing with them and enjoying their company. Her relationship with Hiro became much better and Zero Two came to cherish and love him more than anything, to which she finally understood Hiro's words where he wanted them to understand each other. The two had shown unconditional love for one another and knew that their bond could overcome whatever obstacle fate threw at them. Zero Two was seen to be a very determined girl, as well as very devoted to Hiro, going great lengths for him on the cost of her own safety, and even mentioning that she didn't care about anything as long as he was with her. Zero Two also became closer to everyone in Squad 13, which is particularly seen how protective she became of them, when she became ecstatic upon seeing them fine during the fight against VIRM, and how worried she was when Ichigo and Goro fought off an enemy. When she and Hiro went off to space to fight VIRM's home planet, Zero Two was moved to tears by her friends' words in that they would always wait for them to return. Right before her demise, Zero Two and Hiro were completely willing to sacrifice themselves to save the Earth and so their friends and all the other people could live a good life. They state that even if they would die, the paths they had walked would never fade since their friends would take it even further.", "tags": [{"id": 532, "name": "monster girl"}, {"id": 804, "name": "murderer"}, {"id": 1003, "name": "Mecha Pilot"}, {"id": 1121, "name": "horns"}, {"id": 1021, "name": "pink hair"}], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/272.jpeg", "slug": "zero-two", "alternative_name": "\u30bc\u30ed\u30c4\u30fc, Partner Killer", "birthday_year": "", "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 16863}, {"origin": "", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 676, "name": "I submit some waifus "}, "series": {"description": "\"Before the world ends, kill me or kiss me.\"\r\n\r\nThirty years before the events of Date A Live, an enormous explosion devastates east Asia and kills 150 million people.

She is also quite lazy, as shown in how she goes to sleep as soon as class begins, humorously clashing with her hyperactivity[4].\r\n\r\nMako is quite fearless and has scarcely shown to be intimidated in potentially threatening situations. She also has respect for the authority figures of the school but will voice her opinion about topics such as Ira Gamag\u014dri should wear pajamas in bed instead of being in the nude.\r\n\r\nIf Mako is properly motivated, she is capable of working hard and productively. During her time as president of the Fight Club, she showed a high level of competence and professionalism, as well as the ability to do complex papers and work.\r\n\r\nHaving been poor for her whole life, Mako and her family tend to obsess about wealth. This trait was, at one point, even pushed so far that it caused her to turn against Ry\u016bko temporarily, the latter trying to stop her greed. Like the rest of her family, Mako has an obsessive love for food.\r\n\r\nMako lives with her family in the slums of Honn\u014d City. She spends her days as a no-star student of the Honn\u014dji Academy. She befriended the transfer student, Ry\u016bko Matoi, when she first arrived to the classroom. After Ry\u016bko tried to assault the head of the student council, Satsuki Kiry\u016bin, and fled the scene, Mako was captured because she was seen socializing with her. The Disciplinary group took Mako as a hostage and was saved by Ry\u016bko before she was deep-fried in a tub of scorching oil.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle between Ry\u016bko and the Boxing Club Captain, Takaharu Fukuroda, Mako met up with Ry\u016bko when her family took her in. The next day, she invited Ry\u016bko to stay with her and her family as they walked to school. She was unfazed despite being relentlessly bombarded with a barrage of tennis balls to the face. Mako was apprehended by the tennis club captain, Omiko Hakodate, for missing practice the day before, despite the fact that she was being held hostage at the time. Ry\u016bko saved her as she was being tied up to a post and pelted on all sides by tennis balls. Mako made arguments against Uzu Sanageyama when he tried to fault Ry\u016bko, which resulted in a tennis match between Ry\u016bko and Omiko. Once the match was won, Mako fled with Ry\u016bko under the cover of improvised steam.\r\n\r\nWhen Ry\u016bko was fighting a losing battle against Satsuki, Mako intervened between them and made a speech about how Ry\u016bko should have no reason to be ashamed of showing her body, as well as commented that she and her family was talking about Ry\u016bko\u2019s body the night before. The speech motivated Ry\u016bko to embrace wearing Senketsu and was finally able to maximize her potential.\r\n\r\nDuring the event known as the \u201cNo-Late day\u201d, Mako argued back to Gamag\u014dri when he was questioning Ry\u016bko's choice of current attire, and the argument later ended with how he should be wearing pajamas; instead of sleeping in the nude unless he wishes to get sick.

This is demonstrated when Goku takes noticed of her assembly with the Z Fighters at the 25th World Martial Arts Tournament, leading to the retort \"Look, he noticed. How cute.\" (in Japanese she says \"Took you a while idiot!\"). Shortly after this, she is asked by the World Tournament Announcer if her real name is legitimately \"No. 18\", to which she responds \"My father was pretty dull\" (in Japanese, she replies \"That it doesn't matter\" before tossing the number at the World Tournament Announcer). Although she isn't characterized for this, 18 can be very curious if she is really interested in something, to the point of activating Android 16, and wondering what present she will give to her husband Krillin, to the point of a dispute of a wish with the others using the Dragon Balls. She often expresses herself in her cool and downplayed manner well into her marriage with Krillin, often smiling in a somewhat subdued fashion that conveys her very laid back personality, in Super, however, she is often seen smiling. However, 18's sense of humor is not always tactful, as she jokingly expressed to Future Trunks that she wanted reimbursement for him killing her alternate universe counterpart, much to Future Trunks's displeasure. This is a rare instance where Android 18's humor was anything but tactful, as per her usual timing. She is also shown to be rather prideful.\r\n\r\nAs an older sister and delinquent, and later as a wife and martial artist, Android 18 is shown to be outwardly demanding, insisting that she and her brother 17, and later she and Krillin, have to make strides to improve the family's financial situation, demanding and insisting Krillin to join the Tournament for the prize money, and forcing Mr. Satan into a deal about giving her 20 million Zeni, and also wanting Shenron to grant her wish for a present for Krillin. She is shown to be quite greedy, desperately wanting the 20 million zeni from Mr. Satan, and going as far as to destroy his property and multiplying the prize money a hundred-fold, much to Mr. Satan's chagrin, but by the time Majin Buu arrived on the scene, this greediness seemed to have dissolved, and presumably forgot about the deal. In the Game Boy Advance game Dragon Ball Z: Supersonic Warriors, Android 18 is hinted to dislike driving solely because of Android 17's insistence in driving around aimlessly without anything better to do. However, 18 still exhibits some of her sensitivity, especially towards her twin brother, daughter and husband. This is in stark contrast to her alternate self from Future Trunks' timeline, where she is a murderous sociopath who cares for no one but herself and her brother. 18 also possesses a vast distaste if not outright hatred of violence against children, to the point that after witnessing Lord Beerus's attacks against Gotenks she lost her temper and proceeded to assault him, despite his decisively superior power. This is likely due to her instincts as a mother and fondness for her friends' children despite being frequently annoyed by the underage Super Saiyans.\r\n\r\nBy the time of Dragon Ball Super, she is seems to have grown more kinder, often seen smiling and is more closer to Krillin and Marron compared to last time, where she is shown always folding her arms and looks withdrawn from the characters (like Vegeta and Piccolo, with the former before being accustomed to earthly society), only smiling when she sees her daughter and participates in some activities with the characters, like in the Battle of Gods Saga arc, she participates in the bingo tournament, and she no longer demands Mr. Satan of any money, and she is shown to be quite compassionate towards her husband. After hearing him that to think he could be killed by Frieza twice, she suggests joining him in battle, although Krillin told her to stay and protect Marron, and deeply admired her husband as he left, calling him \"cool\". Later, when she encounters Future Trunks after so many years, she is shown to be more kind and friendly to him than the last time they met, giving him a fist and joking about her future self's death. Android 18's closer relationship with Krillin had led her to want to give a present for him, which she wanted to use the Dragon Balls to wish for a present, when Bulma told #18 that having her and Marron is better than having any present, she was struck with flattery, causing her face to blush, implying that she really loves her husband, and even cheers for him during Universe 6 and Universe 7's baseball match.\r\n\r\nIn the events in Dragon Ball GT, Android 18 has a very close attachment to her now older daughter, Marron and protects her when she is in danger. When Krillin was killed by her brother, Android 17 due to Hell Fighter 17's control, Android 18 emotionally cries over her husband's death despite being a cyborg and admitting she loves him as she shows her vengeful and rage to her brother for what he had done. When she confronts her brother for the second time, she smiles at Goku due to his friendship with her husband as she assists him to avenge Krillin's death.", "tags": [{"id": 479, "name": "dragon ball"}, {"id": 191, "name": "strong"}, {"id": 1357, "name": "artificial lifeform"}, {"id": 1321, "name": "non-human"}, {"id": 1374, "name": "married"}], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/320.png", "slug": "android-18", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": null, "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 702}, {"origin": "", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 210, "name": "Dris"}, "series": {"description": "Araragi Koyomi is a third year high school student who is almost human again after having briefly become a vampire.

Asuka is designated as the Second Child (\"Second Children\" in the original Japanese versions) of the Evangelion Project and pilots the Evangelion Unit-02. Her surname is romanized as Soryu in the English manga and Sohryu in the English version of the TV series, the English version of the anime movie and on Gainax's website.\r\n\r\n\u201c\tAre you stupid?\t\u201d\r\n\u2014Asuka\r\n\r\nAsuka is only one quarter Japanese, which accounts for her Japanese name but European appearance. Asuka is a native of Germany, having been raised there, though her nationality is technically American. Asuka's native language is German, and in both the series and the manga she tends to curse in German. Asuka was born to an American father (unknown) and a German/Japanese mother (deceased). She is a child prodigy and has earned a university degree in an unspecified field as a teenager; she also speaks fluent Japanese, but has trouble reading and writing kanji. Asuka had years of training starting from a young age to become a pilot for the Evangelion. She is characterized by her red hair and equally fiery temper. Asuka is very proud of being an Eva pilot, and near-constantly wears her A10 nerve clips in her hair, because she wants everyone around her to know that she is a pilot. Asuka's iconic catch-phrase (always directed at Shinji) was \"anta baka?!\" (\u3042\u3093\u305f\u30d0\u30ab\u30a1?![?]), \"anta\" being a contraction of \"anata\" meaning \"you\" and \"baka\" literally meaning \"fool\" or \"idiot\". The official English voice recording renders this as \"What are you, stupid?!\"\r\n\r\nAsuka has red hair and blue eyes. She dresses up in a signature school uniform that includes a blue dress, white socks and a pair of black shoes. Asuka's hair is held together with her Interface Headset. To complete the ensemble, a red bow on her collar provides a centerpiece as well as a bit of contrast against her blue outfit.\r\n\r\nHer mother, Kyoko Zeppelin Sohryu, was a scientist of Gehirn's German branch of the Evangelion Project. When Asuka was four years old, Kyoko participated in a contact experiment with Unit-02 similar to the experiment performed by Yui Ikari with Unit-01. She survived the test but became insane, believing that Asuka's doll was her daughter and refusing to acknowledge the real Asuka, referring to her as \"that girl over there.\" She eventually commits suicide by hanging herself; Asuka found her body when she went to tell Kyoko the good news that she had been chosen to become an Eva pilot.\r\n\r\nAfter Kyoko's suicide, Asuka's American father remarried a German doctor. This new mother is immediately repelled by Asuka's defensive nature, and finds herself unable to become attached to her. While talking to Shinji Ikari, Asuka states that she doesn't hate her stepmother, but she feels as if she could never replace her real mother.\r\n\r\nDuring Kyoko's funeral, Asuka's grandmother had said to Asuka that she was \"a strong girl\", but it was alright if she needed to cry. However, Asuka protested against the idea and told her grandmother that she had to take care of herself for now on. From that day on, Asuka promised herself that she would never cry again. This causes her to repress a great deal of emotions, not to mention the emotional scarring that came from her mother's illness and death, leaving her twisted and vulnerable towards the end of the series.\r\n\r\nAsuka is a very proud individual, especially in her piloting, and comes across to others as proud and strong, with a very high opinion of both her appearance (particularly her recently \"busty\" body) and her skill as an Eva pilot. She is stubborn and finds it difficult to express her true feelings to others. She does not like being looked down upon or told what to do as she wants to be viewed as an adult. She is aggressive and can be very opinionated. However, this personality is a front that protects a very vulnerable and insecure girl, a side which the viewer sees in her dreams or thoughts. She is often violent and intrusive of other people's space, especially Shinji's. She also has a strong need to be self-sufficient, and has a great deal of difficulty dealing with her self-perceived failure when she does need help.", "tags": [{"id": 1003, "name": "Mecha Pilot"}, {"id": 1041, "name": "orange hair"}, {"id": 1259, "name": "tsundere"}, {"id": 2057, "name": "worst girl"}], "display_picture": "https://api.waifuchain.moe/image/370.jpeg", "slug": "asuka-langley-soryu", "alternative_name": "", "birthday_year": "2001", "waist": "0.00", "age": null, "creator_id": 183}, {"origin": "Japan", "weight": "0.00", "creator": {"rolename": "", "id": 1151, "name": "A Small Volcano"}, "series": {"description": "\"Before the world ends, kill me or kiss me.\"\r\n\r\nThirty years before the events of Date A Live, an enormous explosion devastates east Asia and kills 150 million people.
